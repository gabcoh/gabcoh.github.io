My primary interests lie in computer security, full stack development, and computer graphics. Apart from CS and Math, I am deeply interested in Effective Altruism and in particular questions regarding moral philosophy and conciousness. I am a long time runner, new swimmer, and hopefully soon-to-be triathlete. </p> </div> <div class="question"> <h3 class="question-header"> What is this website? </h3> <i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i> </div> <div class="answer"> <p> Short answer: It's a work in progress. <br> Longer answer: this is my personal webpage. You can find my resume and a link to my blog here. Along with my blog, I hope to be adding more content to this page in the near future. In the mean time enjoy, the shapes.</p> </div>  </div> <div id="footer"> <a href="https://home.gabecc.me/index.php/s/yZaqtaxGHB6ZrSZ"> Resume <i class="fa fa-file"></i> </a> <a href="https://gabecc.me/blog.html"> Blog </a> </div> </div> <div id="background"> </div> <script src="/dist/js.9c09f594.js"></script> <script src="/dist/canvas.bf46d567.js"></script> </body></html>
