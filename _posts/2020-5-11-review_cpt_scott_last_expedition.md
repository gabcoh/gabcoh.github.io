I guess, I'll be putting of writing about uinput for another day...

I just finished reading Captain Robert "Falcon" Scott's journals of his second,
and final, expedition to the south pole. I can't remember exactly what led me to
be interested--I think it may have been some offhanded comment in Jon Krakauer's
Eiger Dreams--but the journals are entirely free on project Gutenberg so there
wasn't anything stopping me from giving them a try. And try them I did. Since I
read it on my kindle, I'm not entirely sure how long the book really is, but it
certainly felt long. It is a testament to Scott's descriptive ability that
reading his journal's often felt like an endless march through a bleak
monotonous landscape.  But, unlike Scott, I was able to make it to the end.

On a more serious note, I recognize that it's a collection of journals and not a
novel or even a historian's account of the journey. Much of the journals are exactly
what you would expect to be recorded in a captain's personal journal.  Scott
gives nearly daily descriptions of the temperature, weather, quality of the snow
surface, and distance marched. Presumably these would be useful records for
future journeys to the south pole, but considering the
[advancements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole_Traverse) in polar
travel since Scott, even if I wanted to head to the south pole, most
of these records probably wouldn't be relevant. I came mostly for a tale of
adventure in what was one of the final (above water) unexplored areas on
earth--a place
where the explorers weren't just some of the first Europeans to arrive, but were actually some of the
first people to even be there. And to be honest, the journals
disappointed. Not to say that there wasn't anything of value in them, but the
ratio of interesting content to snow descriptions and weather reports was quite
low.

With that said, I must admit that after spending a few weeks working through the
journals (I am a slow reader, but this also wasn't the only thing I was
reading), the end that I knew was coming was surprisingly heart wrenching. I
guess, even if it felt like a slog, I actually felt like I got to know some of
the crew and I grew to like Captain Scott.

This brings me to something that I was thinking about quite frequently
throughout the journals. While I know that Captain Scott has become a
controversial figure, this book is literally my only source of information about
his expedition. I understand from its preface that Scott and his crew have been
accused of being irresponsibly ill prepared for the arctic environment. Knowing
this,
I found it interesting that Scott is constantly extolling the amazing
abilities of his crew. The worst Scott has to say about one of his crew comes
when his party is near death and he writes something to the effect of
'after falling into that crevasse and getting a fatal concussion Evans has
become a real downer'. Aside
from this, Scott does not have enough space in his journal to discuss all of the
positive attributes of everyone he brought along on the expedition. I see there
as being two possible explanations. (1) This journal was never meant to be
private and even had he survived, Scott was planning on publishing and wanted to
portray everything in the best possible light. This would certainly explain his
incessant optimism and the purported unstrained relationships between every member
of a diverse group of Englishmen who were trapped together in a small hut
without sunlight in extreme cold for many months. Another explanation might be
that these expeditions could be considered the equivalent of modern day trips to
the ISS. Great Britain really did send their most resilient and resourceful on
this trip and Scott's descriptions of them are accurate. Frankly, I don't know
which is closer to the truth. I want to believe the latter, but I think its more
likely that Scott was really just trying to portray the journey in the best
possible light.

Was reading it worthwhile? Probably not, I probably should have cut my losses
earlier, but at least I know something about Robert "Falcon" Scott's last
expedition to the South Pole. That counts for something, right? ...right?

PS. If you're interested in learning about this expedition, I would recommend
checking out Herbert Ponting's account of the journey. He was the photographer
and his account includes many amazing photos that are not included in Scott's
journals. I only read very little of the actual text of Ponting's account but it
seems like it may be pretty good too. I don't think it's in the public domain,
but I was able to get a copy online through my university.
