I'm adopting a new philosophy with respect to writing. Namely, I want to do it
more. There are many reasons that I want to start doing this. Here are a few:

- If you couldn't tell yet, I am a bad writer. I want to improve and the only
  way to that is to do this.
- I want to start contributing back to the online community which I have taken
  so much in my life. I don't want to be part of the
  [99%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_Internet_culture) anymore.
- It seems to that the smartest people in the world are the ones that write. I
  want to see which direction the causality goes.
- I think that writing will force me to clarify my thoughts on many issues in a
  way that I don't have to do when I'm just thinking about them. Hopefully it
  will also help me to think more clearly when I'm not writing, but we'll see.

With those ideas in mind, I plan on starting to post here more frequently. For
now, my focus will simply be on quantity. I'm not going to worry about producing
excellent, or even good work; I just want to produce something. To be completely
honest, for now these posts are primarily for me.  Hopefully, if I keep it up,
the quality will improve and I may be able to write things that are useful or
interesting to others. Only time will tell...

I will probably write about whatever I happen to be working on and thinking
about at the time. If I can work up the courage, I might even write about some
of my beliefs or values that I think are important and that could benefit from
being. The next post will likely be about the uinput api in linux and accessing
it in Haskell, but we'll see.
